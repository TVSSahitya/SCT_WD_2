This is my 2nd Task in SkillCraft Technologies Web Development Internship.
I created a stopwatch web application.
This Stopwatch includes features such as start, pause, reset.
The logo is displayed with CSS styling, and the title provides context for the app.
The stopwatch functionality is managed by JavaScript, and ensures a user-friendly interface, and it's interactive for a great user experience.
